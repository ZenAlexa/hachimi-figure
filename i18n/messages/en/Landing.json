      {
        "question": "What types of images work best?",
        "answer": "Anime-style illustrations work best, including character art, fan art, stickers, etc. We recommend clear images with visible characters. Real photos or realistic styles may not produce ideal results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you ensure consistency across multiple generations?",
        "answer": "Our algorithm extracts key character features (face shape, hair color, outfit, etc.) and maintains them across generations. You can also enable 'Lock Character Features' for enhanced consistency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I control the background and text?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can choose 'Character Only' to keep the original background, or 'Full Image' to transform everything. For text in images, you can protect or redraw it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use generated images commercially?",
        "answer": "Pro and above users have commercial rights for original character generations. For fan art of existing IPs, commercial use must comply with the original IP holder's terms."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why don't you offer 3D model export?",
        "answer": "We focus on generating high-quality figure-style images rather than 3D modeling. Image generation is faster and more cost-effective, better suited for quick previews and social sharing."
